# Gaza-map-system-Dijkstra-

Algorthims Project Gaza map system (Dijkstra) â€¢ A robust map system for navigating Gaza using Java. This system leverages graphs and hash maps and other Data structures and sorting algorithms to efficiently store and retrieve location data, including streets, crossroads, and real-world coordinates sourced from Google Maps. It employs the Dijkstra algorithm to identify the shortest path between any two points, ensuring optimal route planning. This project prioritizes both time and space complexity for efficient performance.
